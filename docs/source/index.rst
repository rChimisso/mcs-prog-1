MatIter documentation
======================

Description
-----------

| A simple project made for our university course *Metodi del Calcolo Scientifico* that provides iterative solvers for Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) systems.
| 
| This project includes:
| 
| - **Documentation**: Extensive Readme, Changelog, and Sphinx-generated codebase docs.
| - **Report**: A short report with results and analysis.
| - **Test data**: A few data samples in `Matrix Market format <https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html>`_.
| - **CI**: Automatic code analysis and deployment.
| - **Releases**: Prebuilt `executables <https://github.com/rChimisso/mcs-prog-1/releases>`_ for Linux and Windows.

Setup
-----

Setting up the environment is pretty easy:

1. Set up **Python 3.12.9** (you can use any environment manager or none).
2. Install the dependencies from the file ``requirements.txt``.

The suggested IDE is `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_, and settings for it are included.

Usage
-----

.. code::
   usage: MatIterEngine [-h] [-A A_POS] [-x X_POS] [-tol TOL_POS] A [x] [tol]
   
   Compares four different iterative solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient) in solving the SPD system defined by Ax = b.
   
   positional arguments:
     A                     Path to the .mtx file for the A matrix.
     x                     Path to the .mtx file for the exact solution vector x; default [1., ..., 1.].
     tol                   Floating-point tolerance (â‰¥ 1e-14); default 1e-08.
   
   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -A A_POS, --A A_POS, -matrix A_POS, --matrix A_POS
                           Named form of the A-matrix argument. Overrides the positional A if both are given.
     -x X_POS, --x X_POS, -sol X_POS, --sol X_POS
                           Named form of the solution vector x; overrides the positional x if both are given.
     -tol TOL_POS, --tol TOL_POS
                           Named form of the tolerance tol; overrides the positional tol if both are given.

You can either use the prebuilt `executables <https://github.com/rChimisso/mcs-prog-1/releases>`_ for your platform, or build it yourself.

To build the ``MatIterEngine`` executable yourself, simply run the following command in the project root:

.. code:: powershell

   pyinstaller ./src/main.py --name MatIterEngine --onefile

This will create an executable for your platform.
